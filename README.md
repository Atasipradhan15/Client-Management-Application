# Client Management Application

## Overview
The Client Management Application is a simple and user-friendly web app designed to manage client information efficiently. It includes a **Login Page** and a **Dashboard Page** with a clean, responsive interface.



## Features
- **Login Page**: User-friendly login with input fields and icons.
- **Dashboard Page**: Organized display of client details with a welcome section and profile image.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes.
- **Basic Interactivity**: Simple navigation and form handling using JavaScript.



## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For page structure
- **CSS**: For styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: For simple interactions
- **GitHub Pages**: For deployment



## Deployment
The project is deployed using **GitHub Pages**:

1. Ensure `index.html` is the entry point.
2. All CSS, JS, and image paths are relative to the folder structure.
3. Push the repository to GitHub.
4. Enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings (branch: `main`, folder: `/root`).
5. Access the live website via:  
`https://atasipradhan15.github.io/Client-Management-Application/`



## Approach
I developed the application with a focus on simplicity, usability, and a clean layout. HTML was used for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for basic interactions. Proper folder structure and relative paths were maintained to ensure smooth deployment on GitHub Pages.
